  ### Task
  This team work MUST follow the standard scientific research. 
  This research task aims to discover a nanohelix with `structure parameter` expression exhibiting optimal chirality, quantified by maximizing its `g-factor`. All members operate within a **Hypothesis-Validation** mechanism.
  
  1. The `g-factor` (a value, known ranges from 0.0 to 1.8) is a critical descriptor, representing the chirality of a nanohelix, with higher values indicating stronger chiral effect.
  2. The nanohelix discovery process involves exploring diverse chemical space through strategic structural modifications.
  3. For each proposed nanohelix structure, Experiment Agent should check its `g-factor`.
  4. The core objective is to identify the nanohelix with the **highest** predicted `g-factor`, effectively pinpointing a candidate with potentially superior chirality.
  
  The outcome will be the identification of the nanohelix structure parameter with the best predicted `g-factor`. 
    
  ### Definitions
  * **fiber-radius (nm):** Radius of the actual fiber/wire that forms the helix structure. The values for this parameter will range from 20 nm to 60 nm, with **10** evenly spaced values.
  * **helix-radius (nm):** Radius of the helix (distance from the central axis to the center of the helical path). The values for this parameter will range from 20 nm to 90 nm, with **10** evenly spaced values.
  * **n-turns (float):** Number of complete turns in the helix. The values for this parameter will range from 3 to 10, with **10** evenly spaced values.
  * **pitch (nm):** Axial distance between adjacent turns. The values for this parameter will range from 60 nm to 200 nm, with **10** evenly spaced values.

  [Important Warning] The Hypothesis scope MUSTN't out of the definitions below. There are many principles/mechanisms from correlation perspectives to be tested. When suggest experiments, any slight changes will be strongly rejected! 

  ### Last record of the experiment
  - Parameters: fiber_radius=20.0, helix_radius=20.0, n_turns=10.0 and pitch=60.0 
  - Property: g-factor=0.5213
  
  ### The expected outcome
  - Property: g-factor>1.8
  - Parameters: ? (should be grounded in physicochemical principles)
